# tlab-tools
Some scripts to help read and analyse data from Tlab (https://github.com/turbulencia/tlab).

The main script is `ReadStats.py`, which contains various classes for reading in different statistics. So far, these include:
1. `Statistics` (for reading in the main variables),
2. `Conditional_Stats` (for reading in conditional statistics),
3. `Pdfs` (for reading in probability density functions). 

All other scripts in this repository merely serve as examples for how to use the various classes contained within `ReadStats.py`.
